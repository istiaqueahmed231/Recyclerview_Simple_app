# CardView Mine

CardView Mine is an Android application primarily designed to demonstrate how to implement a `RecyclerView` to display a dynamic list of items. It also showcases the use of `CardView` UI elements to present each item in the list. The app displays a scrollable list of predefined patterns, where each pattern, consisting of a name and an image, is presented within a CardView.
